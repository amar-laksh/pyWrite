# pyWrite

pyWrite is just a nifty O.C.R. tool created with the magic of python and tensorflow!
### Installation

pyWrite just requires the following packages, so open up a terminal and do-
```sh
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install tensorflow
```
### Instructions
As of now, do the following - 

Firstly, run the main program and let it detect your papers!
```sh
python init.py
```
Your image is stored in the 'img' folder as image.png

Then type - 
```sh
python learn.py image
```
and Voila! your digitized image is saved in the 'pro-img' folder!

### Bonus Time! - Screenshots!

# Coming Soon.. :(

### TODOs

 - Remove the hacky solution in init.py
 - Combine the init.py and learn.py
 - Implement a deeper neural network
